 *
 *  @param maxConnections The maximum number of connections between this instance of RakPeer and another instance of RakPeer. Required so the network can preallocate and for thread safety. A pure client would set this to 1. A pure server would set it to the number of allowed clients. A hybrid would set it to the sum of both types of connections.
 *  @param descriptors    An array of RNSocketDescriptor structures to force RakNet to listen on a particular IP address or port (or both). Each RNSocketDescriptor will represent one unique socket.
 *  @param error          Pointer to NSError object, where error information is stored in case if function fails. You can pass nil if you don't want that information.
 *
 *  @return YES if sturtup succeeded, NO otherwise.
